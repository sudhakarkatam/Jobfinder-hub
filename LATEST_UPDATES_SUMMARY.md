**File:** `src/pages/admin-job-management/components/CreateJobModal.jsx` (lines 348-359)

---

## 3. âœ… SEO-Friendly URLs with Job Title Slugs

### Before & After:

**Before (UUID):**
```
http://localhost:4028/job-detail-view/96e4f723-65a0-4a33-ae6b-0c2e7388ebd8
```

**After (Slug):**
```
http://localhost:4028/job-detail-view/ux-designer-96e4f723
```

### Implementation Includes:

#### A. Database Migration
**File:** `database_add_slug.sql`

- Added `slug` column to jobs table
- Auto-generate slugs from title + UUID prefix
- Trigger for automatic slug creation
- Indexed for fast lookups
- Format: `{kebab-case-title}-{first-8-chars-of-id}`

**Examples:**
- "UX Designer" â†’ `ux-designer-96e4f723`
- "Senior Backend Engineer" â†’ `senior-backend-engineer-a1b2c3d4`
- "Product Manager - Remote" â†’ `product-manager-remote-e5f6g7h8`

#### B. Slug Utility Functions
**File:** `src/utils/slugify.js`

- `slugify(title, id)` - Generate URL-safe slug
- `getJobSlug(job)` - Get slug from job object
- Handles special characters and spaces

#### C. Database API Update
**File:** `src/lib/database.js`

- `jobsApi.getJob(identifier)` now accepts both:
  - UUID: `96e4f723-65a0-4a33-ae6b-0c2e7388ebd8`
  - Slug: `ux-designer-96e4f723`
- Auto-detects format (backwards compatible)

#### D. Updated All Job Card Components

**Files Updated:**
1. âœ… `src/pages/home-page/components/LatestJobsCarousel.jsx`
2. âœ… `src/pages/home-page/components/LatestJobs.jsx`
3. âœ… `src/pages/home-page/components/FeaturedJobs.jsx`
4. âœ… `src/pages/job-detail-view/components/RelatedJobs.jsx`

**Changes in each:**
- Import `getJobSlug` utility
- Pass full job object (with slug) to handlers
- Navigate using slugs instead of IDs
- Include `slug` field in database queries

### Benefits:

**SEO:**
- âœ… Descriptive URLs include job title
- âœ… Better search engine indexing
- âœ… Higher click-through rates

**UX:**
- âœ… Users understand content from URL
- âœ… Shareable and memorable links
- âœ… Professional appearance

**Technical:**
- âœ… Backwards compatible with old UUID links
- âœ… Auto-generated on job creation
- âœ… Unique slugs prevent conflicts
- âœ… Fast lookups with database index

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, execute:
database_add_slug.sql
```

This will:
1. Add `slug` column to jobs table
2. Create slug generation function
3. Update existing jobs with slugs
4. Create auto-generation trigger
5. Add performance index

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```sql
-- Check existing jobs have slugs
SELECT title, slug FROM jobs LIMIT 10;

-- Should see output like:
-- "UX Designer" | "ux-designer-96e4f723"
-- "Backend Engineer" | "backend-engineer-a1b2c3d4"
```

### Step 3: Test

1. Create a new job in admin panel
2. Check it has a slug: `SELECT slug FROM jobs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
3. Navigate to job detail page - URL should use slug
4. Test old UUID links still work (backwards compatibility)

## Documentation Created

1. **`SEO_URLS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Complete guide for slug implementation
2. **`database_add_slug.sql`** - Database migration script
3. **`src/utils/slugify.js`** - Slug generation utilities
4. **`LATEST_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Maintenance Notes

### Creating Jobs
No action needed! Slugs auto-generate via database trigger.

### Editing Job Titles
Slugs don't auto-update when title changes (preserves SEO). To manually update:

```sql
UPDATE jobs 
SET slug = generate_slug('New Title') || '-' || substring(id::text, 1, 8)
WHERE id = 'job-id-here';
```

### Rollback if Needed
Old UUID URLs still work! Backwards compatible.

To fully revert:
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs DROP COLUMN slug;
DROP FUNCTION generate_slug(TEXT);
DROP FUNCTION set_job_slug();
```
