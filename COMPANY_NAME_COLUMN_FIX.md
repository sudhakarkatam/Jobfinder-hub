# Company Name Column Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The job creation form was trying to insert a `company_name` field that didn't exist in the database, causing the error:
```
"Could not find the 'company_name' column of 'jobs' in the schema cache"
```

## Solution
Added a `company_name` VARCHAR column to the jobs table to support simple text-based company names alongside the existing relational `company_id` approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (`database_add_company_name.sql`)
- Added `company_name` VARCHAR column to the `jobs` table
- Backfilled existing jobs with company names from the `companies` table
- Created an index on `company_name` for improved query performance

### 2. Frontend Updates
Updated all components that display jobs to use `company_name` with a fallback to `companies.name`:

#### Files Modified:
1. **src/lib/database.js**
   - Already selecting `*` which includes the new `company_name` column

2. **src/pages/admin-job-management/index.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation to use: `job.company_name || job.companies?.name || 'Unknown Company'`

3. **src/pages/job-search-results/index.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation logic to prioritize `company_name`

4. **src/pages/home-page/components/LatestJobs.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation logic to prioritize `company_name`

5. **src/pages/home-page/components/FeaturedJobs.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation logic to prioritize `company_name`

6. **src/pages/home-page/components/LatestJobsCarousel.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation logic to prioritize `company_name`

7. **src/pages/job-detail-view/index.jsx**
   - Updated main job and related jobs transformation logic

8. **src/pages/job-detail-view/components/LatestJobsSidebar.jsx**
   - Updated job transformation logic to prioritize `company_name`

### 3. CreateJobModal (Already Correct)
The `CreateJobModal.jsx` was already correctly configured:
- Sends `company_name` field when creating new jobs (lines 173-176)
- Does NOT send `company_name` when editing jobs (to avoid conflicts with company_id)

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `database_add_company_name.sql`
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Step 2: Verify the Migration
After running the SQL, verify the changes:
```sql
-- Check that the column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'jobs' AND column_name = 'company_name';

-- Check that existing jobs have company_name populated
SELECT id, title, company_name, company_id 
FROM jobs 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Application
1. If using development server: `npm run dev`
2. If deployed: Redeploy your application

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Creating New Jobs
- Users can now create jobs with a simple text company name
- The `company_name` field will be stored directly in the jobs table
- No need to select from the companies table

### Existing Jobs
- All existing jobs will have `company_name` populated from their linked company
- They will continue to work seamlessly

### Viewing Jobs
- All job listings will display the correct company name
- Priority: `company_name` field > `companies.name` (from relation) > 'Unknown Company'

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Create a New Job
1. Go to Admin Job Management
2. Click "Create New Job"
3. Fill in all required fields including Company Name
4. Click "Create Job"
5. **Expected**: Job should be created successfully without errors

### Test Case 2: View Jobs
1. Go to any job listing page (Home, Search Results, etc.)
2. **Expected**: All jobs should display company names correctly

### Test Case 3: Edit Existing Job
1. Go to Admin Job Management
2. Click edit on any existing job
3. Make changes and save
4. **Expected**: Job should update successfully

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Change
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company_name VARCHAR;
```

### Transformation Logic Pattern
```javascript
// Use company_name if available, otherwise fall back to companies.name
company: job.company_name || job.companies?.name || 'Unknown Company'
```

### Why This Approach?
1. **Backward Compatible**: Existing jobs with `company_id` continue to work
2. **Flexible**: Supports both simple text company names and relational company data
3. **Simple**: Easy to create jobs without managing a companies table
4. **Future-Proof**: Can migrate to full relational design later if needed

## Troubleshooting

### If jobs still don't create:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the SQL migration ran successfully
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow inserts

### If company names don't display:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check if `company_name` column exists: `SELECT company_name FROM jobs LIMIT 1;`
3. Verify the application code was updated and redeployed
