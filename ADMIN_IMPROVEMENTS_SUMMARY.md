## 1. ✅ Apply Link Feature

### What Was Added:

### Where to Find:
**Admin Panel:**
- Job Management → Create New Job / Edit Job
- "Job Details" section → "Application Link" field (after Benefits)

### How It Works:
- Admin enters application URL or email
- When user clicks "Apply Now" → Opens that link
- If no link provided → Shows contact message

### Example Uses:
```
https://forms.gle/abc123          → Google Form
https://company.com/apply         → Company careers page
mailto:hr@company.com             → Email application
[Empty]                            → Shows alert message
```

**Database Migration:** `database_add_apply_link.sql`
