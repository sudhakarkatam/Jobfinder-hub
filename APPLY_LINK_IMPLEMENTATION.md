# Apply Link Implementation Guide

## Overview

Added "Application Link" field for admin to specify where candidates should be directed when they click "Apply Now".

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Database Schema

**File:** `database_add_apply_link.sql`

Added `apply_link` column to jobs table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS apply_link VARCHAR;
```

**Supports:**
- External application URLs (e.g., `https://company.com/careers/apply`)
- Google Forms
- Email addresses (e.g., `mailto:hr@company.com`)
- Any custom application system

---

### 2. ✅ Admin Panel - Create/Edit Job

**File:** `src/pages/admin-job-management/components/CreateJobModal.jsx`

**Added:**
- New "Application Link" field in the form (after Benefits section)
- Optional field with helper text
- Supports URL and mailto formats
- Pre-fills with existing data when editing

**Location:**
- Admin Panel → Job Management → Create New Job or Edit Job
- "Job Details" section → After "Benefits" field

**Field Details:**
- **Label:** Application Link (Optional - Where "Apply Now" button should redirect)
- **Placeholder:** `https://example.com/apply or mailto:hr@company.com`
- **Help Text:** "Enter a URL (job application page, Google Form, etc.) or email (mailto:hr@company.com)"

---

### 3. ✅ Job Detail Page - Apply Now Button

**File:** `src/pages/job-detail-view/index.jsx`

**Updated `handleApply` function:**
- If `apply_link` is provided → Opens the link
- mailto links → Opens user's email client
- External URLs → Opens in new tab
- If no link → Shows alert message

**Example Behavior:**
```javascript
// External link
apply_link: "https://company.com/apply"
→ Opens in new tab

// Email
apply_link: "mailto:hr@company.com"
→ Opens email client

// No link
apply_link: null
→ Shows alert
```

### 4. ✅ Hide Empty Sections

**File:** `src/pages/job-detail-view/components/JobDescription.jsx`

**Updated:**
- Sections with no content are now hidden
- No more empty/placeholder text
- Only shows: Description, Responsibilities, Requirements, Benefits if they have content

**Before:**
- Showed all sections even if empty
- Displayed placeholder text

**After:**
- Only shows sections with actual content
- Clean, professional appearance
